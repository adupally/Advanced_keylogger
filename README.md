Getting Started

Please follow these steps to set up the  Keylogger:

Installation Guide - 
   
   First need to install the required libraries 
   
      For encrypting and Decrypting the files we need to install Cryptography

            pip install cryptography
      For recording the audio we need to install sounddevice

            pip install scipy
            pip install sounddevice

      For screenshot need to install pillow

            pip install pillow
      For control and monitor input devices we need to install pynput
            
            pip install pynput
      For Clipboard data need to install pywin32
            pip install pywin32

      Need to install requests
            pip install requests
      
      For sending mail , module is a part of the standard library need not install separately
